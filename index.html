                        The modern Olympic Games are leading international multi-sport events in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in various competitions. The Summer and Winter Games are each held in a different city every four years, offset from each other by two. Inspired by the ancient Greek Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in 1896. The abuse of amateur rules by the Eastern Bloc in the late 20th century prompted the IOC to begin allowing participation by professional athletes. The growth of the Games has created challenges and controversies, including political boycotts, doping, and commercialisation.
